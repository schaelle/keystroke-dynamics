# Keystroke Dynamics Demo

This project shows how a website could authenticate / identify a user based on how the user uses her keyboard. The project uses [ml.js](https://github.com/mljs) a machine learning toolkit written in Javascript. This project was initially designed for a presentation for the 2018 APJ RSA Conference.
